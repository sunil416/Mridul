In other words, we could use examples of translations to learn\\nhow to translate. This machine learning approach proved quite successful\\n[?].\\nMany security applications, e.g. for access control, use face recognition as\\none of its components. That is, given the photo (or video recording) of a\\nperson, recognize who this person is. In other words, the system needs to\\nclassify the faces into one of many categories (Alice, Bob, Charlie, . . . ) or\\ndecide that it is an unknown face. A similar, yet conceptually quite di\\x0berent\\nproblem is that of veri\\x0ccation. Here the goal is to verify whether the person\\nin question is who he claims to be. Note that di\\x0berently to before, this\\nis now a yes/no question. To deal with di\\x0berent lighting conditions, facial\\nexpressions, whether a person is wearing glasses, hairstyle, etc., it is desirable\\nto have a system which learns which features are relevant for identifying a\\nperson.\\nAnother application where learning helps is the problem of named entity\\nrecognition (see Figure 1.4). That is, the problem of identifying entities,\\nsuch as places, titles, names, actions, etc. from documents. Such steps are\\ncrucial in the automatic digestion and understanding of documents. Some\\nmodern e-mail clients, such as Apple\\'s Mail.app nowadays ship with the\\nability to identify addresses in mails and \\x0cling them automatically in an\\naddress book. While systems using hand-crafted rules can lead to satisfac-\\ntory results, it is far more e\\x0ecient to use examples of marked-up documents\\nto learn such dependencies automatically, in particular if we want to de-\\nploy our system in many languages.

The average college senior typicallyknows very little about subjects like neural networks, genetic algorithms, or Baysiannetworks, and this book goes a long way in demystifying these subjects in a veryclear, concise, and understandable way. Moreover, the first-year grad. student who isinterested in possibly doing research in this field needs more of an overview than todive deeply into one of the many branches which themselves have had entire books written aboutthem. This is one of the few if only books where one will find diverse areas oflearning (e.g. analytical, reinforcment, Bayesian, neural-network, genetic-algorithmic)all within the same cover.But more than just an encyclopedic introduction, the author makes a number ofconnections between the different paradigms. For example, he explains thatassociated with each paradigm is the notion of an inductive-learning bias, i.e. theunderlying assumptions that lend validity to a given learning approach. These end-of-chapter discussions on bias seem very interesting and unique to this book.Finally, I used this book for part of the reading material for an intro. AI class, andreceived much positive feedback from the students, although some did find thepresentation a bit too abstract for their undergraduate tastes\\n Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you?  \\n (Report this)  22 of 27 people found the following review helpful:\\n Great compilation, May 18, 2001By Steven Burns (-) - See all my reviewsThis review is from: Machine Learning (Hardcover)This book is completely worth the price, and worth the hardcover to take care of it.The main chapters of the book are independent, so you can read them in any order.The way it explains the different learning approaches is beautiful because: 1)itexplains them nicely 2)it gives examples and 3)it presents pseudocode summaries ofthe algorithms.

The overarching theme of learning problems is that\\nthere exists a nontrivial dependence between some observations, which we\\nwill commonly refer to as xand a desired response, which we refer to as y,\\nfor which a simple set of deterministic rules is not known.

It occurs frequently in practice: for instance, when performing spam\\n\\x0cltering, we are interested in a yes/no answer as to whether an e-mail con-\\ntains relevant information or not. Note that this issue is quite user depen-\\ndent: for a frequent traveller e-mails from an airline informing him about\\nrecent discounts might prove valuable information, whereas for many other\\nrecipients this might prove more of an nuisance (e.g. when the e-mail relates\\nto products available only overseas). Moreover, the nature of annoying e-\\nmails might change over time, e.g. through the availability of new products\\n(Viagra, Cialis, Levitra, . . . ), di\\x0berent opportunities for fraud (the Nigerian\\n419 scam which took a new twist after the Iraq war), or di\\x0berent data types\\n(e.g. spam which consists mainly of images).

I found the 2nd edition ofRussell and Norvig to be a better introduction where it covers the same topic, whichit does for everything I can think of, except VC dimension.The book sorely needs an update, it was written in 1997 and the field has movedfast. A comparison with Mitchell\\'s current course (materials generously availableonline) shows that about 1/4 of the topics taught have arisen since the book waspublished; Boosting, Support Vector Machines and Hidden Markov Models to namethe best-known. The book also does not cover statistical or data mining methods.Despite the subjective complaint about lack of depth it does give the theoreticalroots and many fundamental techniques decently and readably.

The feature map \\x1emaps observations xfromXinto a feature space H.\\nThe map\\x1eis a convenient way of encoding pre-processing steps systematically.\\nAnalogous expressions can be computed for \\x16\\x00. Consequently we may ex-\\npress the classi\\x0ccation rule (1.21) as\\nf(x) =mX\\ni=1\\x0bihxi;xi+b (1.22)\\nwhereb=m\\x002\\n\\x00P\\nyi=yj=\\x001hxi;xji\\x00m\\x002\\n+P\\nyi=yj=1hxi;xjiand\\x0bi=yi=myi.\\nThis o\\x0bers a number of interesting extensions. Recall that when dealing\\nwith documents we needed to perform pre-processing to map e-mails into a\\nvector space. In general, we may pick arbitrary maps \\x1e:X!Hmapping\\nthe space of observations into a feature space H, as long as the latter is\\nendowed with a dot product (see Figure 1.21). This means that instead of\\ndealing withhx;x0iwe will be dealing with h\\x1e(x);\\x1e(x0)i.\\nAs we will see in Chapter 6, whenever His a so-called Reproducing Kernel\\nHilbert Space, the inner product can be abbreviated in the form of a kernel\\nfunctionk(x;x0) which satis\\x0ces\\nk(x;x0) :=\\n\\x1e(x);\\x1e(x0)\\x0b\\n: (1.23)\\nThis small modi\\x0ccation leads to a number of very powerful algorithm and\\nit is at the foundation of an area of research called kernel methods. We\\nwill encounter a number of such algorithms for regression, classi\\x0ccation,\\nsegmentation, and density estimation over the course of the book. Examples\\nof suitablekare the polynomial kernel k(x;x0) =hx;x0idford2Nand the\\nGaussian RBF kernel k(x;x0) =e\\x00\\rkx\\x00x0k2for\\r >0.\\nThe upshot of (1.23) is that our basic algorithm can be kernelized . That\\nis, we may rewrite (1.21) as\\nf(x) =mX\\ni=1\\x0bik(xi;x) +b (1.24)\\nwhere as before \\x0bi=yi=myiand the o\\x0bset bis computed analogously.
